  /*
   * Directions: Create a simple calculator
   *
   * Develop a calculator that accepts user input to perform calculations.
   * (Use the java Math class when applicable)(Check the Java quick reference)
   *
   * Include the following attributes:
   * > a double only accessible by the current class that stores the value of pi.
   *
   * Include the following objects:
   * > create an object of the scanner class to accept user input. (imported for you)
   * > create a geometry object of the calculator class.
   *
   * Implement the following methods: (use the provided identifiers)
   * > Calculator constructor
   * > (add) static method that accepts two integers and returns their sum.
   * > (sub) static method that accepts two integers and returns their difference.
   * > (multiply) static method that accepts two integers and returns their product.
   * > (divide) static method that accepts two integers and returns their quotient.
   * > (remainder) static method that accepts two integers and returns the remainder of their division.
   * > (randomNum) static method that accepts two integers and returns a random number between the two values
   * > (areaOfRect) non static method that accepts two doubles and returns the area of a rectangle
   * > (areaOfTri) non static method that accepts two doubles and returns the area of a triangle
